# Troop Tools

A local app for Scoutmasters that generates reports (PowerPoint decks, HTML dashboards, CSV/VCF exports) from TroopWebHost and my.scouting.org data.

Currently supports:

- **Advancement Report** - Patrol-level breakdown of uncompleted rank requirements (Scout through First Class). Identifies the highest-impact items to plan activities around.
- **Troop Health Report** - Committee-meeting deck with membership demographics, rank distribution, recent advancements, Eagle pipeline, and scouts needing follow-up.
- **Merit Badge Analysis** - Troop-wide merit badge analytics: scouts a few requirements from finishing a badge, Eagle coverage, scout progress, popular electives, badges never earned, and stale badges worth repeating.
- **Patrol Visualizer** - Snapshot of patrol composition with age and rank variance, plus rebalancing suggestions that prioritize clearing out unassigned scouts first.
- **Roster Audit** - Scans the active youth roster for data quality issues: missing dates of birth, scouts without a patrol, and duplicate names.
- **Roster Reconciliation** - Compares youth on my.scouting.org against TroopWebHost. Flags who needs to be added, who needs investigation, who's missing a BSA ID, and any name or rank discrepancies.
- **Troop Contacts Export** - Exports adult leaders from the active roster into a contacts file. Import directly into Google Contacts or tap to import on iPhone.

## Install (one-time)

1. Download the latest `TroopTools-Setup-vX.X.X.exe` (Windows) from wherever you were given the link.
2. Run it and follow the installer. No admin rights are needed - it installs to your own user account.
3. Windows may show a SmartScreen warning ("Windows protected your PC") because the installer isn't code-signed. Click **More info → Run anyway**. This is a one-time warning.
4. When it finishes, Troop Tools launches automatically and opens in your browser. You'll also find it in the Start Menu.

A macOS `.dmg` build exists but is less tested - if you hit issues there, please report them.

## First-run setup

The first time you open Troop Tools, a setup wizard asks for:

- **Troop name** - used in report titles.
- **TroopWebHost site path** - the part of your TroopWebHost URL before `.troopwebhost.org` (e.g. if your site is `https://Troop123YourCity.troopwebhost.org`, enter `Troop123YourCity`).

That's it - no report IDs to look up. TroopWebHost's built-in reports (Active Roster, Uncompleted Rank Requirements, Merit Badge History) use the same identifiers across every org, so those are wired in for you.

You can revisit these anytime from the **Settings** button on the dashboard.

## Two ways to use it

### 1. Sign in (recommended)

Sign in with your TroopWebHost credentials. The app uses them once to log into your TroopWebHost site in a hidden browser, then automatically downloads the CSVs each report needs.

- Your credentials stay on this computer. They live in memory only - they're not written to disk, and they're cleared when you log out or restart the app.
- After 30 minutes of inactivity the session expires automatically and you sign in again.

When you sign in, each report card shows a single "Fetch & Generate" button. Click it and your browser's normal download dialog will appear with the file - save it wherever you like.

### 2. Manual upload (fallback)

You can also skip the login and just drop in CSVs yourself. Export the right reports from TroopWebHost or my.scouting.org manually, drop them into the appropriate slots on each card, and click Generate.

Useful when:
- You don't want to put your TroopWebHost password into the tool
- TroopWebHost is down or the automation breaks
- You want to test changes against a saved snapshot

## Privacy

- CSVs are processed locally and deleted after each report runs.
- Credentials are held in memory only while you're signed in.
- Nothing about your troop, your scouts, or your credentials ever leaves your computer. All HTTP traffic is between your browser and your local server. The only external service this tool ever talks to is TroopWebHost itself, using the same login flow you'd do manually in a browser.
- Settings (troop name, subdomain) are saved to a small file in your user profile, not inside the installed app folder.

## Troubleshooting

**Windows warns "Windows protected your PC" when I run the installer**
The installer isn't code-signed (that costs money we haven't spent on a hobby tool). Click **More info → Run anyway**. This is safe if you got the installer from a trusted source.

**The browser shows "This site can't be reached"**
The app may still be starting, or it's not running. Reopen it from the Start Menu.

**Login fails with "Couldn't find the username field" or "Couldn't find the Log On link"**
The TroopWebHost site path may be wrong. Make sure you entered just the path segment (e.g. `Troop123YourCity`) and not the full URL.

**Login fails with "invalid username or password"**
The credentials weren't accepted by TroopWebHost. Verify them by signing into TroopWebHost manually in your browser.

**A fetch says the signed-in account doesn't have permission for that report**
Ask your Key 3 or Committee Chair to grant Scoutmaster-level access or Report permissions. In the meantime, use the **manual upload** path as a workaround.

## For developers

### Running from source

Requires Node.js 18+.

```
npm install
npm start
```

This downloads the app's dependencies plus a copy of Chromium (~150 MB) used to log into TroopWebHost on your behalf. `npm start` opens the dashboard automatically; the port auto-increments past 3001 if something else is already using it.

### Building the installer

```
npm run build:win     # requires Inno Setup 6 (jrsoftware.org/isdl.php)
npm run build:mac     # must be run on a Mac (hdiutil is macOS-only); unsigned
```

Output lands in `dist/win/` or `dist/mac/`. See `scripts/build.js` for what each step does - it compiles with `@yao-pkg/pkg`, bundles a Playwright Chromium next to the binary, and wraps it with an installer.

### How to add a new report

Drop a new file in the `reports/` folder that exports a manifest and a `generate` function:

```js
const manifest = {
  id: "my-report",
  name: "My New Report",
  description: "Short description shown on the dashboard card",
  icon: "📊",
  inputs: [
    {
      key: "roster",
      label: "Roster CSV",
      hint: "Where to export from",
      required: true,
      twhReport: "roster",   // Optional: enables auto-fetch from TroopWebHost
    },
  ],
};

async function generate(inputs, outputDir, options) {
  // inputs.roster will be the path to the CSV (uploaded or fetched)
  // options.troopName is populated from Settings automatically
  // Generate your output here, save to outputDir
  return {
    filePath: "/path/to/output.pptx",
    fileName: "output.pptx",
    stats: { scoutsAnalyzed: 105 },  // optional - shown in UI after generation
  };
}

module.exports = { manifest, generate };
```

If `twhReport` matches a recipe in `twh/downloads.js` (`roster`, `requirements`, or `meritBadges`), the report becomes available as a one-click "Fetch & Generate". If you omit it, the report still works via manual upload. To add a new TroopWebHost recipe, edit the `RECIPES` object in `twh/downloads.js` and add the report's `menuItemId` - find it by running the report manually in TroopWebHost and reading `Menu_Item_ID=` out of the URL.

### File locations

- `public/` - HTML, CSS, and JS for the dashboard UI
- `reports/` - One file per report, each self-contained
- `shared/` - Utilities used by multiple reports (CSV parser, name normalization, dates)
- `twh/` - TroopWebHost automation (Playwright login + download)
- `settings.js` - Persisted settings (project dir in dev, OS user-data dir when packaged)
- `scripts/build.js` - Standalone installer build pipeline
- `server.js` - Express server that ties it all together
